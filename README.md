# Advent of Code 2015 (the 2022 edition)

Somewhere in the middle of all this I needed an excellent
excuse to really learn some of the ins and outs of 
a new language and what better way to do
bite sized tasks than with Advent of Code? As excellent
as the Rust bible is, I find it a bit boring to not learn 
the hard way (i.e., while actually doing something that
interests me), so here I am. 

This is obviously going to be very painful as I had 
only really been halfway through the bible before 
dropping head first into this.
