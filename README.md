# Advent of Code 2015 (the 2022 edition)

Somewhere in the middle of all this I needed an excellent excuse to really learn some of the ins and outs of a new language and what better way to do bite sized tasks than with Advent of Code? As excellent
as the Rust bible is, I find it a bit boring to not learn  the hard way (i.e., while actually doing something that interests me), so here I am.

2024 update: picking up where I last left off. I've written one (relatively) small app in Rust at this point but have forgotten much, so practicing again.

# To run the puzzle output

```
cargo build
cargo run --bin <puzzle number>
```
